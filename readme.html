General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================

kd-Tree Node
--------------

<!--
Describe the `Node` data type you used to implement the 2d tree data structure.
-->

My `Node` data type holds a `Point` and a `Value` to represent the symbol table. It also holds
references to nodes `left` and `right` to represent both of the corresponding directions in
tree. Finally, it holds a `Partition.Direction` `dir` to show with direction the node is
partitioning.


Nearest Neighbor
------------------

<!--
Describe your method for nearest neighbor search in a kd tree.
-->

My `nearest(q)` function recursively traverses the tree to find the partition bound that `q` lies
within. When backtracking through the tree, it checks the other side of the partition to see
if there is a point on that side that is closer to `q` than `nearest`. This method works effectively
for all cases. This method also works for the `nearest(q, k)` function but compares the
distance of `pq.max()` when backtracking instead of `nearest`.






Analysis
===============


Memory
-------

<!--
Using the 64-bit memory cost model from the textbook and lecture, give the total memory usage in bytes of your 2d tree data structure as a function of the number of points $N$.
Use tilde notation to simplify your answer (i.e., keep the leading coefficient and discard lower-order terms).
Include the memory for all referenced objects (including `Node` and `Point` objects) except for `Value` objects (because the type is unknown and the object is owned by the client).
Also, include the memory for all referenced objects, including any references to the `Direction` enum.
-->

instance of                | bytes
---------------------------|---------
`Point`                    | $32$
`Node`                     | $16$
`PSKDTree` with $N$ points | $\sim 16N$

Memory breakdown for `Node`:

24 bytes of overhead

3 references (2 `Node`, 1 `Point` => 16 bytes

1 `Point` => 32 bytes

1 Enum => 16 bytes



Runtime
--------

<!--
How many nearest neighbor calculations can your brute-force implementation perform per second for `input100K.txt` (100,000 points) and `input1M.txt` (1 million points), where the query points are random points in the unit square?
Explain how you determined the operations per second.
(Do not count the time to read in the points from file or to build the data structure.)

Repeat the questions above with the 2d tree implementation.
--->

file            | brute force | 2d tree
----------------|-------------|---------
`input100K.txt` |         $259$ |     $1111125$
`input1M.txt`   |         $10$  |     $529468$

I initialized the two files into a brute force and a 2d tree for each file. I used a while loop to
count the number of nearest operations using `Stopwatch.java` to track time, resetting the
stopwatch for each tree. I then outputted the count for each tree to the console.




Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

I had a little trouble getting the `get()` function to work for the 2d tree, but I was able to
solve the issue. Getting the `nearest(q)` and `nearest(q, k)` to work properly had some
difficulties but I was able to get both working with no issues. The nearest functions work
for all cases.




Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

<!-- ... -->
I received help from Dr. Denning on the implementation of `nearest()` and `get()` in the 2d
tree. I also discussed the implementation of `nearest()` with classmates. Whiteboarding was
very useful for this project.



<!--
Since this is a small group assignment, give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
-->

<!-- ... -->
Fly home, buddy. I work(ed) alone.



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

<!-- ... -->
The toughest part was developing the algorithm for `nearest(q)`. Once I did this, I was able to
adapt the algorithm to `nearest(q, k)`. I spent probably about 5 hours thinking about the
solution, 2 hours writing and debugging code, and 1 hour doing testing and the writeup. I
enjoyed working on this assignment!
